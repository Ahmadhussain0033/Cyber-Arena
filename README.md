## ‚õèÔ∏è Mining System Deep Dive

### **How Mining Works**
The crypto mining system simulates real cryptocurrency mining:

1. **Hash Rate**: Your mining power (measured in H/s)
2. **Efficiency**: Percentage of maximum possible earnings
3. **Real-Time Earnings**: Coins accumulate while mining is active
4. **Automatic Payouts**: Earnings added to balance when stopped

### **Mining Power Progression**
- **Starting Power**: 500 H/s for new accounts
- **Game Victories**: +50 H/s per win
- **Maximum Power**: 2,000 H/s (100% efficiency)
- **Upgrade Strategy**: Win more games to increase earnings

### **Earnings Calculation**
```
Earnings Rate = (Hash Rate / 2,000,000) * Base Rate
Base Rate = $0.50 per hour
Maximum Hourly = $0.50 (at 2,000 H/s)
```

### **Mining Features**
- **Background Operation**: Continues while app is closed
